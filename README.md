# FigureHub

This is a temporary place holder of this project.

## Scenarios 

Imagine you have 7 credit cards. They are from different finantial institutions, different currencies or even different countries, 
and they have billing cycle starting from 7 different days, and 7 paydays. Let's imagine you forget one of them. If you are lucky, 
that card can automatically pull the minimum payment from your chequing account and the bank are not going to complain anything. 
But if you forget to pay a card that can't automatically pull money from your chequing account, you are totally up to your finantial
institutions' mercy, they would send this to the collections. 

FigureHub is going to change this. No need to open 7 apps a day to check how is your credit cards doing. Balances, remaining credits, 
payday reminder, all of your dream tools just make your life easier.
